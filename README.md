# bradenfrazer.com, Portfolio Website

This portfolio website serves as the 3rd major rebuild of my website, [bradenfrazer.com](https://www.bradenfrazer.com), and is meant to showcase my personal brand and the work that I've done. The site is built as a React SPA with some reusable components for the basic UI and webpage sections, and with a simple object data structure for projects as those are what change the most when I usually make website updates. The full stack is as follows:

## Stack includes:
- View: **React**
- Language: **TypeScript**
- Styling: **Tailwind CSS** + **class-variance-authority**
- Additional UI: **Heroicons** (icons)
