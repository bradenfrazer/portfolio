# bradenfrazer.com, Portfolio Website

![SCR-20231107-ojla](https://github.com/bradenfrazer/portfolio/assets/14165342/ff6a6f01-0121-4276-943a-978feafe826e)

This portfolio website serves as the 3rd major rebuild of my website, [bradenfrazer.com](https://www.bradenfrazer.com), and is meant to showcase my personal brand and the work that I've done. The site is built as a React SPA with some reusable components for the basic UI and webpage sections, and with a simple object data structure for projects as those are what change the most when I usually make website updates.

As an engineer currently in the UI/UX design space, I felt it was important to have a portfolio that accurately reflects my skills, personality, brand, and most importantly - my work!

My last site was built in 2018, and even had some code dating back to my first website launch in 2016 - yikes! It was pure HTML and CSS, with bits of JS, Bootstrap 4 and PHP sprinkled in. I‚Äôve experienced practically my entire professional career since then, grown a ton, and obviously much has changed in the webdev landscape.

Crucially, while the previous design was clean and minimal, it felt a bit dated (it reeked of standard Bootstrap elements!) and didn‚Äôt do much to highlight my personality or brand.

My new portfolio site runs as a React SPA - overkill, sure, but blazing fast to make updates to when I want to showcase new work. What are some of my favorite things about this rebuild?

üíª Projects Front & Center: this is the main reason people actually come to my website, and I previously hid my projects too far down the page, requiring a lot of scrolling

üñåÔ∏è Tailwind CSS: for quick & easy styling, and no longer keeping around tons of old unused CSS (the previous version had lots)

‚öôÔ∏è Data Structure: I can update my projects with a simple JS object data structure, rather than copy + pasting tons of lines of HTML as I did before.

üíÅüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Personality: there are subtle animations for my own flare, and this showcases the beginnings of my own personal design system I am building! Is a personal design system necessary? Absolutely not, but I am a UX guy after all ;)

Also, it should hopefully go without saying, but this design, like everything in my portfolio, is my OWN! You won‚Äôt find this in some Behance or Dribble template.
